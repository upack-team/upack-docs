# How to run Steedos DX Project?

The package of the Steedos Platform consists of metadata and microservices and needs to be loaded into the Steedos Platform to run. 

The Steedos DX development environment launches packages using a microservices approach and connects to the Steedos platform via Transporter.

## Deploy & Run Steedos Platform

First, you must deploy and run Steedos Platform. You can follow the [Self Hosting Tutorial](/deploy/deploy-docker) to deploy Steedos on a server, or launch a local Steedos Platform.

```bash
cd steedos-platform
docker-compose up
```

You can also refer to the instructions in the `./steedos-platform` dir to run Steedos Platform with Node.js.

### Register Admin Account

Upon its first launch, the system will prompt you to register an account and create an organization. This account will also become the administrator account for the organization.

### Create an API Key

You can log in to the Steedos server with administrator credentials, go to the settings app, select the API Key menu, and create a new API Key.

## Setup Environment Variable

### Setup TRANSPORTER

The Steedos package operates using the [Moleculer](https://moleculer.services/docs) microservices framework, connecting microservices through the configuration of a unified Transporter.

[Moleculer Transporter](https://moleculer.services/docs/0.14/networking) is an important module if you are running services on multiple nodes. Transporter communicates with other nodes. It transfers events, calls requests and processes responses â€¦etc. If multiple instances of a service are running on different nodes then the requests will be load-balanced among them.

```bash
TRANSPORTER=redis://127.0.0.1:6379
```
:::tip
Please make sure the TRANSPORTER you configured matches the Steedos server you wish to connect to and that the network is interconnected. 
:::

:::danger
For running in a production environment, be sure to configure the Redis password.

### Setup Metadata Server

Setup environment variables required for metadata synchronization.

```bash
steedos source:config
```

- Metadata Server: METADATA_SERVER is the ROOT_URL of the Steedos server you wish to connect to.
- Metadata API Key: METADATA_APIKEY is used to authenticate your identity. 

This command writes environment variables into the .env.local file, 

```bash
METADATA_SERVER=
METADATA_APIKEY=
```

You can also set the above environment variables directly without running the command.

## Run Steedos Packages

### Install Dependences

```bash
yarn
```

### Run Packages

You can use the [moleculer-runner](https://moleculer.services/docs/0.14/runner) command to launch the steedos packages.

```bash
npx moleculer-runner steedos-packages/*/package.service.js --hot --repl
```

you can also use the `start` script on `package.json` to run this command

```bash
yarn start
```

:::tip
Please note that the Steedos DX project supports multi-package development, and the above command simultaneously launches all packages under the steedos-packages folder.
