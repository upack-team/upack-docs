# Lesson 3: Creating Application

Steedos allows users to create custom applications to meet various business needs. Custom applications are a collection of logically related objects, fields, functionalities, and layouts. This tutorial will guide you on how to create a Todos application in Steedos, and link it to the Projects and Todos objects.

## 1. Concept of Custom Applications
In Steedos, custom applications are built by combining different standard or custom objects, fields, reports, dashboards, and other elements. They provide customized solutions for specific business processes.

## 2. Planning the Project Management Application
First, plan your project management application. Determine which objects, fields, reports, and dashboards are needed. In our example, we need two main objects: Projects and Todos.

## 3. Creating Projects and Todos Objects
As described in the previous tutorials, create Projects and Todos objects and add necessary fields to them.

## 4. Establishing Relationships Between Objects
Link the Todos object to the Projects object using lookup or master-detail relationships. This way, each Todo can be associated with a specific project.

## 5. Adding Tabs
Create exclusive tabs for your application to facilitate easy navigation for users.

### Configuring Tabs
1. In settings, select "Tabs".
2. Add a tab for each of the Projects and Todos objects.
3. Customize the labels and icons of the tabs to ensure they are intuitive and easy to understand.

## 6. Creating the Projects Custom Application
Go to Steedos settings, choose "Applications" and create a new custom application.

### Creating the Application
1. In "Applications," select "New" to create a new custom application.
2. Name your application (e.g., "Todos") and provide a description.
3. Choose a primary icon and color for the application.
4. Add the previously created Projects and Todos tabs as part of the application.

## 7. Setting Up Security and Permissions
Ensure the application's security and permissions are correctly configured so that different users can access the application according to their roles.

### Security
1. In "Profiles & Permission Sets," set application access permissions for different profiles and permission sets.
2. Ensure that only authorized users can access sensitive data.

## 8. Testing and Deploying the Application
Before deploying the application, conduct comprehensive tests to ensure everything runs smoothly.

### Testing the Application
1. Create and modify Projects and Todos records.
2. Test the accuracy of reports and dashboards.
3. Gather user feedback and make adjustments as needed.

## Conclusion
By creating a custom Projects application, you can effectively utilize the powerful features of Steedos to manage projects and related to-do items. Custom applications not only improve data management efficiency but also optimize user workflows by providing customized tools and views. As your business evolves, you can continue to expand and refine the application to meet changing needs.
