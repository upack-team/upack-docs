The Steedos platform comes with built-in visual application building tools that empower you to customize Steedos to meet your business needs. You can also build your own applications to share and store information that's important to you, all without needing any programming knowledge.

As a new user, building your first application on the Steedos platform is a straightforward and intuitive process. We'll guide you through the steps to create a custom application.

### Step 1: Plan Your Application

Before you begin, think about your business needs. Determine what functions you want your application to perform, what objects you need, and how the user interface should be laid out.

### Step 2: Access the App Manager

Log in to your Steedos account, click the "Settings" icon, then type "Applications" in the quick find box, and select the option that appears to open the App Manager.

### Step 3: Create a New Application

In the App Manager, click the "New Application" button, select "Custom Application," and click "Next."

### Step 4: Define Application Properties

- **Application Name**: Name your application.
- **Application Icon**: Choose an icon to represent your application.
- **Description**: Describe the functions of your application and the value it provides to users.

### Step 5: Choose Application Tabs

The navigation menu of the application is composed of tabs. You must create tabs first and then add them to the application.

Select the standard or custom object tabs that your application will include. These tabs will serve as the main components of your application.

### Step 6: Assign User Permissions

Determine which users will have access to this application. You can set different access permissions for different users or user groups.

### Step 7: Save and Test

Save your application and test it in the development environment. Ensure all features are working as expected.

### Step 9: Deploy to Production Environment

Once you are satisfied with the application's functionality and have completed testing, you can deploy it to the production environment for all users to access.

### Step 10: Gather Feedback

After deploying the application, collect feedback from users and make improvements based on it. The success of the application depends on the active participation and feedback of users.

By following these steps, you'll be able to create your first custom application on the Steedos platform, tailored to your unique business needs.
