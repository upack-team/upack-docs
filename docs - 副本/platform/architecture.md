# Technical Architecture

Steedos Platform is an open-source alternative to the Salesforce low-code platform, designed to provide similar capabilities with a flexible and scalable architecture. The backend is built on Node.js, the frontend uses Amis and React, and the database is powered by MongoDB. Here's an overview of Steedos Platform's technical architecture:

- **Backend with Node.js**: The backend of Steedos Platform is developed using Node.js, a widely adopted technology for server-side development. This choice allows Steedos to leverage Node.js's asynchronous, event-driven architecture, providing scalability and performance. Node.js is known for its extensive library support and robust community, ensuring that Steedos remains up-to-date with the latest features and best practices.

- **Frontend with Amis and React**: The frontend of Steedos Platform is built using Amis, a low-code framework, and React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Amis allows for rapid development with minimal coding, while React provides the flexibility to create complex and interactive UI components. This combination enables users to build custom interfaces quickly and efficiently.

- **Database with MongoDB**: Steedos Platform uses MongoDB as its primary database. MongoDB is a NoSQL database that offers high performance, scalability, and flexibility. Its document-oriented structure aligns well with Steedos's data-centric architecture, allowing for easy storage and retrieval of complex data. MongoDB's support for horizontal scaling ensures that Steedos can handle large datasets and high traffic volumes.

- **Low-Code Development**: The platform's low-code approach empowers users to create applications with minimal coding, making it accessible to a broader range of developers. This approach reduces the time required to develop applications and enables rapid iteration and prototyping.

- **Workflow and Automation**: Steedos Platform includes robust workflow and automation capabilities, allowing users to create business processes without extensive custom coding. The platform supports both visual workflow design and automation rules, providing flexibility in defining business logic.

- **Integration and APIs**: Steedos Platform offers a comprehensive set of APIs for integration with external systems. These APIs allow for seamless data exchange and interoperability with other software applications. The platform also supports custom API development for more specialized integration needs.

- **Security and Compliance**: Security is a top priority for Steedos Platform. It provides role-based access control, data encryption, and compliance with industry standards to ensure data protection and privacy. The platform also includes audit logs and security features for enhanced accountability.

- **Scalability and Flexibility**: With its cloud-based architecture, Steedos Platform is designed to scale as business needs grow. The platform's modular design and support for both SaaS and on-premises deployments provide flexibility in terms of infrastructure and compliance requirements.

Overall, Steedos Platform's technical architecture is designed to provide a robust, scalable, and flexible foundation for building business applications. Its use of Node.js for the backend, Amis and React for the frontend, and MongoDB for the database creates a modern and efficient environment for low-code development. The platform's focus on workflow automation, integration, and security ensures that it can meet the needs of a wide range of business scenarios, from small-scale applications to complex enterprise solutions.
