# Trigger managed permissions 

While Steedos provides various built-in solutions to easily achieve precise field and record level permission control as described above, some permission requirements in unique project scenarios may not be met by these methods alone. Therefore, the Steedos permission engine also incorporates beforeFind triggers, which allow personalized and more advanced permission issues to be addressed through code.
