# Permission Sets

A permission set is a collection of settings and permissions that give users access to various tools and functions. Permission sets extend users’ functional access without changing their profiles and are the recommended way to manage your users’ permissions.

Users can have only one profile but, they can have multiple permission sets. You can assign permission sets to various types of users, regardless of their profiles.
