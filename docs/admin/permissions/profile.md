# Profiles

Profiles define how users access objects and data, and what they can do within the application. When you create users, you assign a profile to each one.

Every user is assigned only one profile, but can also have multiple permission sets. When determining access for your users, use profiles to assign the minimum permissions and access settings for specific groups of users. Then use permission sets to grant more permissions as needed.

#### standard profiles

Steedos comes with several standard profiles(admin、user、supplier、customer), and if more, additional custom profiles can be added to expand upon them.
