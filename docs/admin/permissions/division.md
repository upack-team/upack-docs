Divisions let you segment your organization's data into logical sections, making searches, reports, and list views more meaningful to users. Divisions are useful for organizations with extremely large amounts of data.

## How Divisions Work

Divisions can be assigned to users and other kinds of records. For example, you can create a report to show the opportunities for just the North American division to get accurate sales numbers for the North American sales team.

- Record-level division—Division is a field on individual records that marks the record as belonging to a particular division. 
- Default division — Users are assigned a default division that applies to their newly created accounts, leads, and custom objects that are enabled for divisions.
