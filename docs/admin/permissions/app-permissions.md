# Application Permissions

Steedos supports application authorization based on permission sets, which can be used to restrict users under a certain permission set/profile to only see certain applications.

To restrict the view of applications, go to the "Company Settings > Permission Set/Profile" section of the "Settings" application. Select the permission set or profile that you want to restrict from viewing applications, then choose the allowed applications in the "Authorized Application" field. Any applications that are not selected here will be restricted from view. If the authorized application field is left empty, all applications will be authorized for this permission set or profile.
