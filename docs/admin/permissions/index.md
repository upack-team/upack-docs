Steedos provides a flexible, layered data sharing design that lets admins control user access to data. Managing data access enhances security by exposing only data thatâ€™s relevant to users. Use permission sets, permission set groups, and profiles to control the objects and fields users can access. Use sharing rules to specify the individual records that users can view and edit.
