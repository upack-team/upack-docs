# Steedos PC-MES Solution

Steedos PC-MES is a comprehensive solution designed for managing the entire business chain of precast concrete component production. It utilizes QR codes as data carriers to seamlessly connect project planning, product lists, BOM materials, production processes, and inventory management. By streamlining contract, design, manufacturing, inventory, and delivery processes, Steedos PC-MES offers businesses a standardized approach to managing precast concrete operations, enabling rapid business expansion. Here's an overview of its key features and functionalities:

## Industry Background

Precast concrete structures are gaining renewed attention as an industrialized construction method. In this approach, concrete structures are broken down into various precast units (such as beams, columns, and slabs) that are cast in a factory, transported to the construction site, and assembled to form a complete structure. As the industry grows, businesses are facing challenges in managing increasing volumes of precast concrete components, often relying heavily on manual processes and intervention. This creates a need for a standardized, digitized tool to support business management, improve operational efficiency, and reduce management costs.

## Business Challenges

Traditional Excel-based project management leads to inaccurate planning, production processes are difficult to control, and quality inspections rely on manual records, which are prone to errors. Managing the precast yard manually is time-consuming, and there's no quality traceability system to track accountability. To address these challenges, Steedos PC-MES offers a comprehensive solution to manage precast concrete production and operations.

## Core Features

- **Unique QR Code Identification**:
  Each precast component is assigned a unique QR code, allowing for quick access to its parameters, design drawings, and production records via mobile applications.

- **Production Tracking and Process Control**:
  Production processes are meticulously recorded, including the operator, operation time, and results. This feature allows managers to monitor the production process accurately.

- **Mobile Collaboration**:
  Real-time collaboration through mobile platforms, allowing teams to communicate and coordinate tasks efficiently using popular applications like WeChat and DingTalk.

- **Yard Management and Inventory Control**:
  Real-time inventory data and rapid component location reduce the time and effort required for yard management, improving delivery efficiency.

- **Data Dashboards**:
  Automatically generated data dashboards provide insights into production metrics, including concrete pouring volumes, inventory levels, and shipping activities. Multi-device support allows users to monitor data across various platforms.

- **Master Data Management**:
  Supports a multi-company structure, allowing group-level management while maintaining individual company operations. Integration with third-party systems like DingTalk, SAP, and others ensures data consistency.

- **Project Management**:
  Project data cards can be imported in bulk, allowing users to manage project timelines, track production progress, and archive completed projects for future reference.

- **Production Management**:
  Customizable production processes and mobile-enabled field operations enhance production control. The system supports integration with SAP for seamless order processing.

- **Shipping and Logistics Management**:
  Integration with third-party logistics systems for creating and managing outbound shipments. The system also supports return handling and quality inspections at the shipping stage.

- **Scalable System Design**:
  The system is designed to be extensible, supporting pallet management, GPS-based transportation monitoring, cost management, and automated production planning for increased automation and efficiency.

Steedos PC-MES aims to streamline the entire precast concrete production process, offering a robust and scalable solution for businesses in this industry. It helps companies manage operations efficiently, ensure compliance, and reduce costs while supporting business growth.
