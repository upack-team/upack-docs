## Form design 

The forms we refer to here are actually application forms. 

When users submit an application, administrators define where users can input information, what information they need to provide, whether it should be entered or selected, and so on in the backend settings.

## Flow design 

After designing the form, administrators need to define the flow of the approval process, including the approval steps and designated approvers for each stage.

In Approval King, each approval stage is called a "node," which is linked to other nodes through connectors. A node may have only one following approval stage, or it can have multiple possible following stages through various connectors. The following approval nodes can be designated by the previous step's approver or automatically determined based on preset condition settings.
