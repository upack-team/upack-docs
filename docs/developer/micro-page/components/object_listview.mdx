description: Steedos微页面引擎，内置列表视图组件 ObjectListView，借助amis渲染器，可以帮助开发人员快速生成一个功能完善的列表视图组件。
---

This is a list view component based on the Steedos object, which displays object records as a table while including functionalities for CRUD and other operation buttons.

## Basic Usage

The most basic usage is to configure the "Object" and "View" properties of the component, which can then display a list page for the specified object.

As shown below, we configure the "Object" property of the list view to be the current object and the "View" property to be the "Effective Personnel" view of the current object.

```json
{
    type: 'page',
    title: 'ObjectListView',
    body: {
        "type": "steedos-object-listview",
        "objectApiName": "${objectName}",
        "listName": "all"
    },
  }
```
