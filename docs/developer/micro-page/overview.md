## Supported Custom Micro Page Types

The Steedos Micro Page Builder supports various types of pages to meet different business needs and scenarios. Here are the available micro page types:

### Application Pages

Application pages are a new type of page that allows developers to design from scratch.

To display the page in the system, the following steps are required:
1. Create a tab on the tab page
2. Configure the tab on the application page

### Record Pages

Record detail pages focus on presenting exhaustive information about a single record. You can customize these pages to display detailed data fields, related table information, statistics, and provide editing, deletion, or other specific record operations.

### List Pages

List pages are important for data presentation, suitable for displaying collections of records, such as customer lists or order lists. You can customize columns, filters, and search functions to enhance the user's data browsing and manipulation experience.

### Form Pages

Form pages are used to collect user input, ideal for creating new records or updating existing data. You can customize form fields, layouts, and validation rules to meet specific data collection needs.

Unlike record pages, the "Form" type of micro page only replaces the pop-up form interface and does not affect the read-only interface effect of the record detail page. Conversely, the "Record Page" type of micro page replaces the entire read-only effect of the record detail page but does not affect the pop-up form interface.
