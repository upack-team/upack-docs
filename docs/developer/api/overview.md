# Introduction to Steedos API

Steedos provides a comprehensive suite of robust APIs, allowing a plethora of opportunities for enterprise integration, development, and functionality enhancement.

## Overview

APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are the backbone of modern digital interaction. Through Steedos's diverse set of APIs, organizations can now integrate Steedos with other external services, systems, and data sources seamlessly. This integration is pivotal for companies to automate processes, synchronize data, and expand the core functionalities of their Steedos solutions.

## Types of Steedos APIs

Steedos offers a variety of APIs, each designed for specific purposes, ensuring that developers can find an API perfect for their requirements. Some of the prominent Steedos APIs include:

### REST API

Steedos's REST API allows developers to use standard HTTP methods such as GET, POST, DELETE, and PATCH to manipulate data. It's accessible via URI paths, and users can send requests and receive responses in JSON or XML format. This API is perfect for when you're using mobile applications and web projects.

### GraphQL API

GraphQL, a query language created by Facebook, enables declarative data fetching where a client can specify exactly what data it needs from an API. Instead of multiple endpoints returning fixed data structures, a GraphQL server operates a single endpoint and responds with precisely the data the client asked for.

The Steedos GraphQL API integrates this powerful query language, enabling a more efficient way to work with the rich data stored in the Steedos environment. This API allows developers to read, create, modify, and delete Steedos data using GraphQL. It's designed to deliver smoother, more intuitive, and more developer-friendly interactions with Steedos's vast array of business data.

### Metadata API

The Metadata API is a powerhouse for developers who need to retrieve, deploy, create, update, or delete the customizations of organization metadata. It's invaluable for managing customizations and for building tools that can manage the metadata model, not the data itself.

## Benefits of Steedos APIs

- **Seamless Integration:** Easily connect Steedos with other platforms, services, and software, breaking silos and encouraging cross-platform functionalities.
- **Automation and Efficiency:** Automate data transfers, synchronize across systems in real-time, and update data without manual intervention, leading to increased operational efficiency.
- **Customization:** Developers can build custom solutions atop the Steedos platform, ensuring the CRM aligns perfectly with business needs and workflows.

## Conclusion

Steedos APIs are indispensable for modern businesses, empowering them to go beyond the standard functionalities and create tailored, integrated, and automated solutions. By leveraging these APIs, companies can significantly enhance their operational efficiency, customer relationship management, and overall productivity.
